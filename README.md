# Log Project
In this project, I have analysed HTTP status code in HAProxy logs with Python.
Also, there is a visualization of CPU, RAM, and Disk Usage extracted by  [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) library using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/).

The paths are handled by Nginx and all codes are on a Docker Swarm Cluster.
